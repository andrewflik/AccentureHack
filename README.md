# VR Driving Simulator For Parkinson Patient 
=================================================================
## Project Overview
We created a 3D driving simulator using Unity3D so patients could drive around and receive a score based on their performance. We built a city and
implemented a car using downloaded prefabs. To test them we had a navigation system give random directions and a grading system based on how
many missed turns and crashes. We realized that our simulator may not be familiar with most people, so we created a tutorial when they could learn the
sensitivity and features of the game.

## Needfinding
We started the hackathon by interviewing Parkinson’s Patients to better understand
their lifestyle. After brainstorming, we were interested in three common themes:

- Reaction Time: Test their driving, as PD is known for decreasing reaction times and
creating body spasms.
- Sleep quality/REM Sleep disorder: Sleep Tracking, being able to track patient sleep
cycles and potential dream acting.
- Cognitive thinking: Cognitive Stimulus, a mental challenge that would be taken
alongside exercise to improve patient cognition.

## Problem statement
- Reaction speeds while driving: We decided on driving because we liked its
novelty and felt that it was an unaddressed safety concern. We wouldn’t
replace the DMV test but rather create a test to reassure patients of their skill.
- Solution: Parkinson’s Patients need a driving reaction-time test to
improve and verify their cognitive and multitasking ability on the road.

## Implementation
We created a driving simulator for Parkinson’s Patients to test their reaction times and multitasking skills. Driving is a major safety concern for patients,
who may have hand tremors and cognitive impairment. The simulator was created in Unity3D and grades a patient by how well they can follow 15
random directions and regular street laws. Our project aims to help caretakers see their patient’s current symptoms and also help patients practice
their reaction time.

## User Testing
We interviewed four Parkinson’s patients to test our simulator. We made two tests of different sensitivity in order to see which variant was preferred.
We asked for initial and post evaluations to understand their driving experience. General feedback included changing the navigation system to 2D ar-
rows, increased sensitivity, flushed out tutorial, and adjusted traffic timers.

## Conclusion
We believe that our driving simulator can help caretakers and doctors better understand the patient’s driving condition and ability to multitask. Our test
may also be used as a safe environment for the patient to practice driving and also understand their current driving condition. Being given a score may
help some patients accept that Parkinson’s is affecting their lives.
